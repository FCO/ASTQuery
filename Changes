Revision history for ASTQuery

{{$NEXT}}

    - Matcher: expand builtâ€‘in RakuAST groups and add ergonomic aliases (.operator, .apply-operator, .variable[-usage|-declaration], .assignment); enrich id-field mapping across classes
    - Debug: gate validator logging behind ASTQUERY_DEBUG; make end printer tolerant; stabilize caller tracking; reduce noisy Name attribute logs
    - Matching: allow Type-based attribute checks on nested nodes; improve validate-ids for variable declarations (#x without sigil)
    - Output: improve matcher gist and handle DEPARSE failures gracefully
    - Tests: add coverage and matcher suites, extend group/id mapping checks, and split debug-path coverage
    - Docs/Tooling: update AGENTS guidance; set coverage baseline to 89.5%
